As a person,

So that I can use a bike,

I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,

So that I can use a good bike,

I'd like to see if a bike is working

| bike            | is_working?         |


my_bike = dockingstation.realease_bike

person.use_bike(my_bike)

my_bike = dockingstation.realease_bike

person.use_bike(my_bike) if my_bike.is_working?
